						This roast chicken with roasted potatoes and garlic sauce is by far my favorite Sunday dinner meal. Once you’ve had roasted potatoes this way, you’ll never want to have them any other way. First of all your house will smell fantastic, you’ll get all the dogs and neighbours at your door because they’ll want a piece of that something you have in your oven.
						You might say by now that I’m obsessed with garlic sauce, and you may be right. I love garlic, and I’ll put garlic in anything I cook. But this is the kind of dinner that my mom put on our table every single Sunday. While I may not make this every weekend now, whenever I do, it’s like a treat. Of course you can make a salad with this heavenly meal. However, you won’t need a salad if you make the garlic sauce, which I have to say it’s a very traditional Romanian sauce for any roasted meat and potatoes.
